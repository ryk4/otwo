														rights.</p>
										</li>
								</ol>

														encrypted form through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase
														transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that
														is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to the
														standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of
														brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure
														handling of credit card information by our Website.&nbsp;</p>
										</li>
										<li>
												<p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to
														the extent necessary to allow them to handle your payment. However, certain third-party service providers,
														such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies for the
														information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. We recommend that
														you read Stripe privacy policy (<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>) and
														PayPal privacy policy (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/privacy/privacyhub">https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/privacy/privacyhub</a>)

										</li>
										<li>
												<p>In most cases personal data are processed and transmitted in the territory of the European Union and the
														European Economic Area, however sometimes it is necessary for us to transfer your details to our service
														providers that are located outside European Union. We always make sure to have appropriate agreements
														covering data processing provisions and we perform regular audits to make sure that the third parties,
														located outside of the EU, are following GDPR rules. When this is permitted by law and is required for the
														reasons given in this policy, we may disclose information about you to third parties that are located in
														the United States and are compliant with EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. You may download a copy of the
														EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>.&nbsp;
